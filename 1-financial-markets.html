                    <p>Financial markets are organized systems or platforms where participants buy and sell financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and derivatives. These assets represent claims on future value— for example, a stock is a share of ownership in a company, entitling the holder to dividends and voting rights.</p>

                    <p>Markets can be physical, like the trading floors of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), where trades are now executed electronically rather than through shouting, or electronic, such as online platforms like Robinhood or E*TRADE, where trades happen via algorithms in milliseconds.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                    <p>Historically, markets date back to ancient civilizations: the Babylonians traded grain contracts around 1750 BCE, and European stock exchanges emerged in the 16th century with the Amsterdam Stock Exchange for trading shares in the Dutch East India Company.</p>

                    <p>Today, global markets handle over $7.5 trillion in daily forex transactions alone (per 2022 Bank for International Settlements data), with total global financial market activity reaching hundreds of trillions in asset values annually, facilitated by technology like high-speed internet and blockchain.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Primary Purpose and Functions</h2>
                    <p>The primary purpose is to connect surplus funds (from savers) with deficit needs (from borrowers). When you buy a stock, you're indirectly funding a company's operations, which could build factories or develop products.</p>

                    <p>Markets also provide liquidity— the ability to convert assets to cash quickly without significant price loss. For instance, during the 2008 crisis, illiquid markets froze, preventing sales and exacerbating losses.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Regulation and Oversight</h2>
                    <p>Regulation ensures fairness: in the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforces rules against fraud; internationally, bodies like the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) set standards.</p>

                    <p>However, markets aren't perfect— they can be manipulated (e.g., pump-and-dump schemes) or disrupted (e.g., flash crashes from algorithmic errors).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Market Psychology</h2>
                    <p>In trading terms, every transaction has a buyer and seller, and prices are set by auction. Understanding this means recognizing that markets reflect collective psychology: optimism boosts prices, fear drives them down.</p>

                    <p>This foundation answers "what" by defining markets as efficient allocators of capital, but also "why" by showing their role in economic stability. It explains how markets operate globally, covering equities, fixed income, forex, commodities, and crypto, without assuming prior knowledge.</p>
