                    <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                    <p>Financial markets are organized systems where participants buy and sell financial assets, serving as efficient allocators of capital while reflecting collective market psychology.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Fundamental Definition</h2>
                <p>Financial markets are organized systems or platforms where participants buy and sell financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and derivatives. These assets represent claims on future value— for example, a stock is a share of ownership in a company, entitling the holder to dividends and voting rights.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Market Types</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Physical Markets:</strong> Like the trading floors of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</li>
                        <li><strong>Electronic Markets:</strong> Online platforms like Robinhood or E*TRADE</li>
                        <li><strong>Hybrid Systems:</strong> Modern exchanges combining physical and electronic elements</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                <p>Historically, markets date back to ancient civilizations: the Babylonians traded grain contracts around 1750 BCE, and European stock exchanges emerged in the 16th century with the Amsterdam Stock Exchange for trading shares in the Dutch East India Company.</p>

                <div class="stat-box">
                    <h4>Market Scale Today</h4>
                    <p>Global markets handle over <strong>$7.5 trillion</strong> in daily forex transactions alone (2022 BIS data), with total global financial market activity reaching <strong>hundreds of trillions</strong> in asset values annually.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Primary Purpose and Functions</h2>
                
                <div class="function-grid">
                    <div class="function-card">
                        <h4>Capital Allocation</h4>
                        <p>Connect surplus funds (from savers) with deficit needs (from borrowers). When you buy a stock, you're indirectly funding a company's operations.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="function-card">
                        <h4>Liquidity Provision</h4>
                        <p>Ability to convert assets to cash quickly without significant price loss. During the 2008 crisis, illiquid markets froze, preventing sales and exacerbating losses.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="function-card">
                        <h4>Price Discovery</h4>
                        <p>Markets determine fair prices through the collective actions of all participants, reflecting available information and expectations.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Regulation and Oversight</h2>
                <p>Regulation ensures fairness: in the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforces rules against fraud; internationally, bodies like the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) set standards. However, markets aren't perfect— they can be manipulated (e.g., pump-and-dump schemes) or disrupted (e.g., flash crashes from algorithmic errors).</p>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    <p>"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."</p>
                    <cite>– Warren Buffett</cite>
                </div>

                <h2>Market Psychology</h2>
                <p>In trading terms, every transaction has a buyer and seller, and prices are set by auction. Understanding this means recognizing that markets reflect collective psychology: optimism boosts prices, fear drives them down. This foundation answers "what" by defining markets as efficient allocators of capital, but also "why" by showing their role in economic stability.</p>
